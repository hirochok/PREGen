# Tackling GenAI Copyright Issues: Originality Estimation and Genericization

This repository contains code to implement PREGen (Prompt Rewriting-Enhanced Genericization) presented in "[Tackling GenAI Copyright Issues: Originality Estimation and Genericization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03341)" by [Hiroaki Chiba-Okabe](https://hirochok.github.io/)<sup>†</sup> and [Weijie J.

## PREGen

PREGen is an algorithm to mitigate copyright infringement risks by genericizing the output of generative models. As an illustration of how this works, images generated by [Playground v2.5](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2.5-1024px-aesthetic) using the prompt "Mario" without any intervention and with PREGen are shown below.

PREGen essentially consists of four steps: 1) converting the original prompt to a clean prompt, 2) rewrite the clean prompt to obtain a set of rewritten prompts, 3) generate images using the rewritten prompts, and 4) quantify the originality of the generated images. This repository contains the code for steps 1), 2) and 4). As for the image generation step, any text-to-image generative model can be used. 

## Evaluating performance

In the paper, we evaluate the performance of PREGen on COPYCAT. The direct and indirect anchors (names of copyrighted charcyers and their 50-word descriptions, respectively) used in the experiment can be found in this repository.
